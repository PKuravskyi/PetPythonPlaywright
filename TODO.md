1. More tests:
   1. Download files
   2. Drag-n-drop
   3. Multiple windows
   4. Waiting for something to happen
   5. Read from pdf file
2. Files handling (csv etc.)
3. AI support. Ideas: auto generate missing docstrings, run RCA based on failure logs
4. Download only necessary browsers during test execution
5. Try to optimize 'Install dependencies' stage to reduce time of installing
6. Test results logging (?)
